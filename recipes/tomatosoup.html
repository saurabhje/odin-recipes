    <h1> Description </h1>
    <p>This simple, quick and easy recipe for homemade fresh tomato soup is perfect to make when tomatoes are ripe in gardens and farmers' markets for a delicious summertime treat.    </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
    </li>
    <li>1 slice onion
    </li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic
    </li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
    </li>
    <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
